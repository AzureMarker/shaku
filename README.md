# Shaku

Shaku is a Rust dependency injection library. See the [docs] for more details,
including a getting started example.

## Acknowledgements
This library started off as "he_di" (later renamed to "shaku") under the
guidance of @bgbahoue and @U007D. Their work inspired the current maintainer
(@Mcat12) to continue the library from where they left off.

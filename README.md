# What is Dependency Injection (aka. Dependency Inversion)?

The idea behind inversion of control is that, rather than tie the classes in your application together and let classes “new up” their dependencies, you switch it around so dependencies are instead passed in during class construction. It's one of the 5 core principles of [SOLID programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))

If you want to read more on that:

# Getting started
## Structure your application
Start by writing a classical application with struct & types (in homage to [AutoFac](https://autofac.org/) I ported their classical "getting started" example) Code excerpts are used below to illustrate this little guide, the complete example is available [here](https://github.com/bgbahoue/he-di/blob/master/shaku/examples/autofac.rs).

```rust
trait IOutput : Send {
    fn write(&self, content: String);
}

struct ConsoleOutput {
    prefix: String,
    other_param: usize,
}

impl IOutput for ConsoleOutput {
    fn write(&self, content: String) {
        println!("{} #{} {}", self.prefix, self.other_param, content);
    }
}

trait IDateWriter : Send {
    fn write_date(&self);
}

struct TodayWriter {
    output: Box<IOutput>,
    today: String,
    year: String,
}

impl IDateWriter for TodayWriter {
    fn write_date(&self) {
        let mut content = "Today is ".to_string();
        content.push_str(self.today.as_str());
        self.output.write("Today is ".to_string().push_str(self.today.as_str()));
    }
}
```

## Mark structs as Component
A component is an expression or other bit of code that exposes one or more services and can take in other dependencies.

Our application has 2 components:
- `TodayWriter` of type `IDateWriter` 
- `ConsoleOutput` of type `IOutput` 

To be able to identify them as components [shaku](https://crates.io/crates/shaku) exposes a `#[derive()]` macro (though the [shaku_derive](https://crates.io/crates/shaku_derive) crate). It is simply done with something like that:
```rust
#[derive(Component)] // <--- mark as Component
#[interface(IOutput)] // <--- specify the type of this Component
struct ConsoleOutput {
    prefix: String,
    other_param: usize,
}
```

In the current version, you need to specify the type of your Component through the `interface` attribute.

## Express dependencies
Some components can have dependencies to other components, which allows the DI logic to also inject these components with another Component.

In our example, `ConsoleOuput` is a Component with no dependency and `TodayWriter` a Component with a dependency to a `IOutput` Component.

To express this dependency, use the `#[inject]` attribute within your struct to flag the property and declare the property as a [trait object](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/trait-objects.html).

In our example:

```rust
#[derive(Component)] // <--- mark a struct as a Component that can be registered & resolved
#[interface(IDateWriter)] // <--- specify which interface it implements
struct TodayWriter {
    #[inject] // <--- flag 'output' as a property which can be injected
    output: Box<IOutput>,
    today: String,
    year: usize,
}
```

## Application startup
At application startup, you need to create a `ContainerBuilder` and register your components with it. 

In our example, we register `ConsoleOutput` and `TodayWriter` with a `ContainerBuilder` doing something like this:
```rust
// Create your builder.
let mut builder = ContainerBuilder::new();

builder
    .register_type::<ConsoleOutput>()
    .as_type::<IOutput>();

builder
    .register_type::<TodayWriter>()
    .as_type::<IDateWriter>();

// Create a Container holding the DI magic
let mut container = builder.build().unwrap();
```

The `Container` reference is what you will use to resolve types & components later. It can then be stored as you see fit.

## Application execution
During application execution, you’ll need to make use of the components you registered. You do this by resolving them from a `Container` with one of the 3 `resolve()` methods.

### Passing parameters
In most cases you need to pass parameters to a Component. This can be done either when registring a Component into a `ContainerBuilder` or when resolving a Component from a `Container`.

You can register parameters either using their property name or their property type. In the later case, you need to ensure that it is unique.

#### When registering components
Passing parameters at registration time is done using the `with_named_parameter()` or `with_typed_parameter()` chained methods like that:

```rust
builder
    .register_type::<ConsoleOutput>()
    .as_type::<IOutput>()
    .with_named_parameter("prefix", "PREFIX >".to_string())
    .with_typed_parameter::<usize>(117 as usize);
```

#### When resolving components
Passing parameters at resolve time uses the same `with_named_parameter()` or `with_typed_parameter()` methods from your `Container` instance.

For our sample app, we created a `write_date()` method to resolve the writer from a Container and illustrate how to pass parameters with its name or type

```rust
fn write_date(container: &mut Container) {
    let writer = container
        .with_typed_parameter::<IDateWriter, String>("June 20".to_string())
        .with_named_parameter::<IDateWriter, usize>("year", 2017 as usize)
        .resolve::<IDateWriter>()
        .unwrap();
    writer.write_date();
}
```

Now when you run your program...
- The `write_date()` method asks shaku for an `IDateWriter`.
- shaku sees that `IDateWriter` maps to `TodayWriter` so starts creating a `TodayWriter`.
- shaku sees that the `TodayWriter` needs an `IOutput` in its constructor.
- shaku sees that `IOutput` maps to `ConsoleOutput` so creates a new `ConsoleOutput` instance.
- Since `ConsoleOutput` doesn't have any more dependency, it uses this instance to finish constructing the `TodayWriter`.
- shaku returns the fully-constructed `TodayWriter` for `write_date()` to use.

Later, if we wanted our application to write a different date, we would just have to implement a different `IDateWriter` and then change the registration at app startup. We won’t have to change any other classes. Yay, inversion of control!

## Changelog
See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see the main changes introduced by the newest version.

## Roadmap
The current implementation of this crate is still WIP. A few identified limitations (being further explorer) are:
- `#[derive(Component)]` should be tested against complex cases & more tests are to be written (e.g, struct with lifetime, generics, ...)
- supports closures as a way to create parameters (at register or resolve time)
